## agora
Server-side application for dealing with our basic club needs.  As of right now, it provides two services: an application and an admin service.  Provides endpoints for creating applications, viewing applications, creating new admins, logging in, etc.

see the wiki for specific information: https://github.com/UCLA-Creative-Labs/agora/wiki

future: finish up the main endpoints and then implement a microblogging service

## agorafrontend
Client-side application built with React.  There is very minimal architecting of components/component tree at the moment and no styling.  This is something that should be thought about and planned.
